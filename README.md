# README for dotfiles-test1

This project is meant to be a starting point for me to work through my process of managing "dotfiles" using git and more specifically github. I only plan to include a few files in here at the beginning and go through a system of adding files, removing files, documenting the what, why, where, and how.

Hopefully this will help me, in my brain, become comfortable with the workflow and in the end be successful with several learning opportunities.

BTW, I am sorta kinda using this blog post as my guide during test1 --> [Dotfiles and Github]( http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/)
